## 📚 **All Tools Overview**

### **Sequential Workflow (0-3)**
Use these in order through your research lifecycle:

#### **Phase 0: Idea Development**
**→ `0_research_idea_checklist.md`** (30 min)
- Evaluate research ideas before starting
- Assess feasibility and novelty
- Define problem scope & identify gaps
- Plan evaluation strategy

#### **Phase 1: Paper Writing**
**→ `1_AI_Research_Paper_Checklist.md`** (continuous use)
- Primary writing checklist during drafting
- Section-by-section guidance
- Self-contained writing ("grandmother test")
- Visual elements & LaTeX formatting
- Figure quality standards

**Companion**: `1_How_to_Use_AI_Research_Checklist.md` - Tips for using tool #1

#### **Phase 2: Quality Assurance**
**→ `2_FATAL_FLAWS_CHECKLIST.md`** (30-60 min before submission)
- Pre-submission fatal flaw detection
- Algorithmic completeness verification
- Mathematical correctness check
- Baseline comprehensiveness
- Statistical validity & number consistency audit
- **70% of rejections are preventable with this check**

#### **Phase 3: Post-Rejection**
**→ `3_rejection_analysis_template.md`** (2-3 hours)
- Systematic rejection analysis
- Reviewer feedback organization
- Root cause analysis
- Fix prioritization & action planning
- Resubmission progress tracking

---

### **Reference Tools (REF_)**
Consult anytime you need specific information:

#### **→ `REF_paper_structure.md`** (2 min lookup)
- Conference-specific structures (CVPR, NeurIPS, ACL, etc.)
- Page allocations (Method=35%, Experiments=28%, etc.)
- Section ordering & required subsections
- Figure placement guidelines

#### **→ `REF_statistical_rigor.md`** (5 min lookup)
- Statistical test selection guide (t-test, Wilcoxon, etc.)
- Effect size calculations (Cohen's d, Cliff's delta)
- Multiple testing corrections (Bonferroni, FDR)
- Proper reporting templates & standards

## ⚡ **Most Common Uses**

| Situation | Use This | Time |
|-----------|----------|------|
| Starting new project | `0_research_idea_checklist.md` | 30 min |
| Writing draft | `1_AI_Research_Paper_Checklist.md` | Continuous |
| "How many pages for Method?" | `REF_paper_structure.md` | 2 min |
| "Which statistical test?" | `REF_statistical_rigor.md` | 5 min |
| "How to report p-values?" | `REF_statistical_rigor.md` | 2 min |
| Day before deadline | `2_FATAL_FLAWS_CHECKLIST.md` | 30-60 min |
| Just got rejection | `3_rejection_analysis_template.md` | 2-3 hrs |

## 🎯 **What Each Tool Covers (No Overlaps)**

| Tool | Unique Focus | Key Content |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| **0_research_idea** | Pre-research validation | Problem definition, novelty check, feasibility, resources |
| **1_AI_Research_Paper** | Writing & presentation | Grandmother test, section guidance, visuals, formatting |
| **2_FATAL_FLAWS** | Critical error prevention | Algorithm completeness, math check, baselines, statistics |
| **3_rejection_analysis** | Post-rejection recovery | Feedback organization, root causes, action plans |
| **REF_structure** | Paper structure | Page allocations, section ordering, conference styles |
| **REF_statistical** | Statistical methodology | Test selection, effect sizes, corrections, reporting |

**Key Principle**: Information appears in exactly ONE place. No redundancy.

## 💡 **Pro Tips**

1. **Use REF_ files early** - Plan statistics BEFORE running experiments
2. **Don't skip fatal flaws check** - 70% of rejections are preventable
3. **Fill rejection template immediately** - While feedback is fresh
4. **Share with co-authors** - Align everyone on quality standards
5. **Bookmark this framework** - You'll reference it throughout research
6. **Check cross-references** - Checklists point to REF_ files when needed

## 📊 **Success Metrics**

This framework helps you achieve:
- ✅ **Complete method descriptions** - No missing algorithm details
- ✅ **Rigorous statistical validation** - Proper tests, effect sizes, corrections
- ✅ **Comprehensive baselines** - All recent relevant work compared
- ✅ **Consistent reporting** - No numerical errors or inconsistencies
- ✅ **Professional presentation** - Clear, accessible, well-structured writing

**Goal**: Make it impossible for reviewers to reject for preventable reasons.

### **What This Framework Prevents:**
- 40% of rejections: Incomplete technical description
- 25% of rejections: Missing baselines
- 20% of rejections: Mathematical/statistical errors
- 10% of rejections: Overclaiming/unsupported statements
- 5% of rejections: Other presentation issues

## 📝 **Key Design Principles**

1. **One Tool, One Purpose** - Each checklist has a specific phase and focus
2. **No Redundancy** - Information appears in exactly one place
3. **Clear Progression** - Tools follow research timeline (0→1→2→3)
4. **Actionable Items** - Every checklist item is specific and verifiable
5. **Reference vs Action** - Workflow tools (0-3) vs lookup references (REF_)
6. **Cross-Referenced** - Tools point to each other when needed
7. **Evidence-Based** - Built from real rejection feedback analysis
