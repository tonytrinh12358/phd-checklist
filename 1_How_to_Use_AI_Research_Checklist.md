# How to Use the AI Research Paper Checklist

## 📋 **When to Use This Checklist**

### **Phase 1: Pre-Writing Planning**
- Use the **Introduction** and **Experimental Validation** sections to plan your evaluation strategy
- Ensure every claim you want to make has a corresponding experiment planned
- Use the **Problem Formulation** guidelines to structure your research question

### **Phase 2: During Writing**
- Follow the **Methodology** organization principles as you write
- Use the **Citation Best Practices** while writing related work
- Apply **Technical Completeness** guidelines to avoid skipping important details

### **Phase 3: Pre-Submission Review**
- Complete the **Pre-Submission Final Check** section thoroughly
- Use the **Claim-Evidence Audit** to verify every statement
- Apply **Figure & Visual Quality** standards to all visuals
- Run the **Accessibility & Self-Containment Audit** to ensure grandmother test compliance
- Check **Strategic Visual Elements** for optimal figure selection

## 🎯 **Key Strategic Insights from Supervisor Feedback**

### **1. The "Grandmother Test" Philosophy**
- **Self-contained writing** - assume readers have no prior knowledge of your specific problem
- **Define everything** - explain all technical terms, acronyms, and method names on first use
- **Progressive complexity** - build from simple concepts to complex ones
- **Accessible narrative** - the main story should be followable by non-experts (except mathematical proofs)

### **2. The "Completeness → Compression" Strategy**
- **Don't self-censor in first draft** - include all important details
- **Refinement = Intelligent Compression** - the best papers are comprehensive papers that are thoughtfully compressed
- **Better 8 pages → 7 pages than incomplete 6 pages**

### **3. The "How vs. What" Principle**
- **What**: "We introduce a novel approach that improves X"
- **How**: "We use DPO training with diffusion models and LLM guidance to improve X by..."
- **Always explain the "How" with technical details and references**

### **4. The "Claims-Evidence Contract"**
- **Every claim in the introduction is a promise to the reviewer**
- **Reviewers will specifically look for evidence of each claimed improvement**
- **Better to claim less and prove it thoroughly than claim more and prove it partially**

### **5. The "Generic Framework" Approach**
- **Use abstract notation** (e.g., $\mathcal{D}$, $\mathcal{M}$) in methodology
- **Instantiate specifics in experiments** (e.g., "We instantiate $\mathcal{D}$ as COCO dataset")
- **Makes your work more generalizable and impactful**

### **6. The "Strategic Visual Elements" Principle**
- **High-impact visuals** - choose 3-4 visuals that meaningfully strengthen each section
- **Visual narrative** - figures should tell a coherent story supporting your text
- **Space efficiency** - optimize visual elements for maximum information density
- **Avoid visual bloat** - every figure should serve a specific purpose

### **7. The "Bullet Point Restraint" Principle**
- **Strategic bullet usage** - only use bullets when doing something special with each point
- **Paragraph flow** - combine related bullet points into coherent paragraphs
- **Section balance** - avoid subsections that are only bullet lists
- **Readability focus** - prioritize smooth narrative flow over list formatting

## ⚡ **Quick Pre-Submit Check** (30 minutes)

1. **Grandmother Test**: Can someone without domain knowledge follow your main narrative?
2. **Technical Terms**: Are all specialized terms defined on first use?
3. **Scan Introduction**: Does every claim have experimental backing planned?
4. **Check Methodology**: Is it organized modularly with clear mathematical formulation?
5. **Verify Figures**: Do they have legends, error bars, and detailed captions?
6. **Citation Audit**: Are you using `\citet` vs `\cite` correctly?
7. **Claims Verification**: Can you point to specific results for each performance claim?
8. **Bullet Point Check**: Are excessive bullet points combined into flowing paragraphs?
9. **Theorem Management**: Do you have 1-2 key theorems with proofs/references?
10. **Visual Strategy**: Have you selected 3-4 high-impact figures that support your story?

## 🔄 **Iterative Improvement Process**

### **Draft 1**: Focus on completeness
- Include all technical details
- Don't worry about page limits
- Use the checklist to ensure nothing is missing

### **Draft 2**: Intelligent compression
- Remove redundancy, not important details
- Ensure logical flow and modular organization
- Polish figures and mathematics

### **Draft 3**: Final refinement
- Complete the pre-submission checklist
- Verify claim-evidence alignment
- Ensure reviewer-friendly presentation
